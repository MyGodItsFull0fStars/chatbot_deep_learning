## Data Analysis

- Occurrence of each word in all words (tokenized)
- how often does a letter occur in the questions and answers
- How balanced is the dataset -> are there an equal amount of question-answer-sets for every title?
- Clustering the question-answer-sets for each title


## Implementation

- Make a model to predict the correct answer for the questions, for this X is the question and y is the answer.
- More training epochs for each model
- Integrate ```wandb``` with a guard to switch on and off

## Other

- Look into further methods to analyze the model/data with help of the course
